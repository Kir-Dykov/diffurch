Policy is this. What is about to be varied or tried a multiple values of, should be a parameter.

For compilation it is only necessary to know
    equation
    events : affect variables and saving
    initial conditions
    discrete variables
    
Not needed:
    values of parameters
    integration bounds
    
    
Can be implicitly set pre-compilation
    events that handle saving 
    
    
Can be implicitly parametrized:
    initial conditions
        constant initial conditions:
            x,y,z -> initial_x, initial_y, initial_z parameters that can be set explicitly or by initial_conditions keyword
        sin-cos initial conditions?
    integration bounds
        initial_time, final_time parameters, set explicitly or by interval=(..., ...)
        
        independent 
        
        
        
Equations is specified as it is.

Initial conditions:
    in pre-compilation specification, 
    it is just one specification of 
    formula that depends on parameters,
    like
        ic = "x = sin(k*t); x' = -k*cos(k*t);"
        ic = "sin(k*t); -k*cos(k*t);"
    
    or, it can be completely omitted, in which case
    the constant initial conditions are implied
        ic = "x = x0; x' = x'0"
    in this case, ic is specified at runtime by values of implicit parameters x0, etc
